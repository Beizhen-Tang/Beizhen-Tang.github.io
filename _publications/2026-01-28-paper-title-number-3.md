Abstract: This study examines how global news media construct the legitimacy of artificial intelligence (AI) across countries, domains, and time, and identifies national conditions associated with cross-country differences in AI sentiment. We analyze 1,007,867 English-language AI news articles from Event Registry (Aug 2023-Feb 2025; 130 countries; 3,152 outlets), combining sentiment estimation, domain-based discourse mapping (Business, Technology, Society), and country-level modeling with robustness and interpretable feature attribution. We find a mildly positive global baseline but substantial cross-national dispersion and domain divergence: Business coverage is more opportunity-oriented, Technology emphasizes feasibility and integration, whereas Society more often foregrounds ethics, trust, and distributional risks. The trajectory is non-linear, with an early-2025 shift toward more governance-centered and critical narratives alongside a reorganization of negative themes. Across countries, sentiment is systematically associated with governance and accountability, press-freedom conditions, territorial-demographic structure, and cultural orientations. These findings advance a four-layer “institution-discourse-practice-cognition” framework showing that AI legitimacy is context-specific and changes over time. Institutionally, the results support domain-sensitive governance that pairs innovation with enforceable accountability; for social policy, they highlight public-facing safeguards and capacity-building where labor, welfare, and inequality risks are salient. Best practices include routine impact assessments in high-stakes domains, periodic independent audits with transparent incident disclosure, and risk-balanced public communication standards.
